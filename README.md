# SVM-Breastcancer-classifier

Dataset: http://www.siam.org/books/ot108
There are two files. One (wdbc.dat) is the data and the other one (wdcb.names) contains explaining information.
There are m = 569 data points with n = 30 measured properties.
Each data point is represented by a row in the data file.
The first two columns present the patient number, and the classification “M” or “B” depending on whether the cells were malignant or benign.
